# txtman
Simple text manipulation program written in Python. Currently has the ability to either CAPITALIZE or a e s t h e t i c i z e whatever text the user currently has in their clipboard.

Dependent on pyperclip in order to function properly, so make sure you have that installed. 

Unix based OS users should chmod +x this script and place it in their PATH variable for maximum shitposting utility.
