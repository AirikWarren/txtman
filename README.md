# txtman
Simple text manipulation program written in Python. Currently has the ability to either CAPITALIZE or a e s t h e t i c i z e whatever text the user currently has in their clipboard.

Dependent on the pyperclip module in order to function properly, so make sure you have that installed. 

Unix based OS users should chmod +x this script and place it in their PATH variable for maximum shitposting utility.
